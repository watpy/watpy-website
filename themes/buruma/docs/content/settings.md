Extract: Available setting for Buruma.

Buruma is being developed to be easy to configure and to use. One of its goals is to be able to adapt itself easily. This can be possible with a good structure that makes possible to configure everything with small changes or additions. Surely, **Buruma doesn't accomplish with this**, but I hope Buruma grows fastly.

## `pelicanconf.py`

In this section you can check the available variables to configure Buruma with your Pelican configuration file (`pelicanconf.py`).
